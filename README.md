# About the Project: 

This project is for my Practical Data Science course, where we created a business problem to then solve with a machine learning model. A large focus of this project is presenting to non-technical stakeholders, so here you will see a few different presentations coupled with python code. 

## Executive Summary

**Problem:** Friendly Dog Park has a mushroom overgrowth problem. They need a method for park staff to classify any poisonous mushrooms for removal. While about only 1% of mushroom species are toxic, mushroom poisoning in dogs can cause symptoms like vomiting, kidney failure and even result in death. Treatment must be prompt, and veterinary visits can be expensive.  

**Solution:** Use a classification model (Decision Tree) to predict the edibility of mushrooms based on various physical characteristics. With this model as a guide, park staff can inspect the grounds daily prior to park opening and remove any potentially poisonous mushrooms. Guides can also be posted on billboards for park guests to reference and follow.

## About Each File
* The "python code" folder includes the .py and .ipynb files for the project. These files include the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model.
* Deliverable #1 is the first stage of the project, which includes the Exploratory Data Analysis portion.
* Deliverable #2 is the second stage of the project, which includes the modeling methods and findings portion.
* Deliverable #3 is the third and final stage of the project, which includes putting Deliverable #1 and #2 together, and refining it.
